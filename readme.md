## Latex

The response in latex is generated by a lazy approach, generating an image using [latex editor](http://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php?lang=en-en) by creating an url putting the equation in the url(with some changes), and sending the url, the bot manages to convert the url to photo and send the photo
